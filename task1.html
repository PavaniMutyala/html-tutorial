        1. The Origins of HTML (Late 1980s - Early 1990s)
        1989 - Tim Berners-Lee & the Invention of the Web
        HTML was conceived by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, while he was working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research).<!--In 1989, he proposed a system to share documents over the internet using hypertext. This system would allow researchers to easily link and access documents across different computers.--> 
        </p>
        
        In 1991, Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web (WWW), a system that used hypertext (text that could link to other documents) to create a network of linked documents. The first version of HTML was part of this system.</h1>
